this_repo_will_self_destruct
============================

prepare for spectacularly broken shit! you've been warned :)
also check sersh's [fork](https://github.com/sersh/this_repo_will_self_destruct) if you like darker themes


# Browser css
Forked from and entirely inspired by the brilliant [Fl√®che](https://github.com/hdni/Fleche) theme by hdni. 

### Firefox
* Install the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) extension.
* Install the [FXChrome](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxchrome/) theme.
* Install the [Vertical Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs/) extension.
* Install the [Moveable Firefox button](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/movable-firefox-button) extension. 
* RESTART FIREFOX
* Go to your [Add-ons Manager](about:addons), select the User Styles page and then write a new style.
* Give the style a name and paste the contents of [fbchan.userchrome.css](https://github.com/offlineric/this_repo_will_self_destruct/blob/master/fbchan.userchrome.css)
* Seriously restart firefox if it looks wrong. If it still looks wrong after that, I guess you can bug in a desktop thread on 4chan/g/ if you see me

note: Lesschrome is no longer a requirement. the close button addon can look nice with some setups though
